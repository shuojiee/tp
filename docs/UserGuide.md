## Glossary

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Workout Session** | A named training session that groups related exercises together (e.g. "Push Day", "Legs"). A workout session acts as a folder — you create it first, then add exercises into it. |
| **Exercise** | A specific movement within a workout session (e.g. "Bench Press", "Deadlift"). Each exercise stores its own weight, sets, and reps. An exercise always belongs to exactly one workout session. |
| **Log / Log Entry** | A timestamped record of your actual performance for an exercise during a particular session. Logs are saved to your history and can be reviewed later with `loglist`. |
| **Remark** | A free-text note attached to a log entry (e.g. "Felt strong today", "Lower back tight"). |
| **Template** | Your saved workout sessions and their exercises serve as reusable templates — the baseline plan you log against each time you train. |

> **In short:** GitSwole uses a two-level hierarchy — **Workout Sessions** contain **Exercises**. When you train, you **log** your performance against that template, building a chronological history you can review anytime.

---
### Feature 13: Storage

**Purpose:** Automatically persists your workout templates and training history to disk so that your data is preserved between sessions.

**How it works:**

GitSwole maintains two data files, both created automatically on first run:

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `data/workouts.txt` | Workout templates (sessions, exercises, weights, sets, reps, completion status) |
| `data/history.txt` | Chronological training log entries created by the `log` command |

Saving is fully automatic — every mutating command (`add`, `delete`, `edit`, `mark`, `log`) writes changes to disk immediately. There is no manual "save" command. On the next launch, GitSwole reloads your data from these files.

> **Note:** The ```|``` character is used internally as a field delimiter. 
> If your workout or exercise names contain ```|```, it will be escaped automatically, 
> but it is best to avoid this character in names to prevent confusion when reading the raw file.  

> **Note:** You may edit `data/workouts.txt` or `data/history.txt` by hand, but malformed entries may cause loading errors. Always keep a backup before manual edits.
 
---

### Feature 14: Date

**Purpose:** Automatically timestamps every training session so you can track when each workout was performed.

**How it works:**

When you start a logging session with `log w/WORKOUT_NAME`, GitSwole captures the current date and time automatically — you do not need to enter a date manually. The timestamp is recorded in `dd-MM-yyyy, HH:mm` format and stored in your history file.

**Example:**
```
Input:  log w/legs
Output: Session started for Legs! Let's get those gains.
```

The history file will contain an entry like:
```
[01-04-2026, 18:30] LEGS workout
```

To review sessions by date, use the `loglist d/DATE` command (see [Feature 20: View History](#feature-20-view-history)):
```
Input:  loglist d/01-04-2026
Output:
=== LOG HISTORY FOR: 01-04-2026 ===
[01-04-2026, 18:30] LEGS workout
deadlift:         :  100kg |  4 sets | 10 reps
...
```

> **Note:** GitSwole uses your system clock. Make sure your computer's date and time are set correctly.
---

### Feature 15: Edit

**Purpose:** Edits the name of an existing workout session, or updates any combination of fields
within a specific exercise - without needing to delete and re-add.

**Format:**
```
edit w/WORKOUT_NAME
edit w/WORKOUT_NAME e/EXERCISE_NAME
```

After entering the command, you will be prompted to enter the fields you wish to change.
Only the flags you provide will be updated; all others remain unchanged.

**Flags for editing:**

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `wn/` | New workout name |
| `en/` | New exercise name |
| `wt/` | New weight (positive integer) |
| `s/`  | New number of sets (positive integer) |
| `r/`  | New number of reps (positive integer) |

**Example — Edit a workout name:**
```
Input:  edit w/push
Prompt: Edit fields (e.g. wn/NewName):
Input:  wn/Push Day
Output: Change Recorded! Edited Workout:
        Push Day | Exercises: ...
```

**Example — Edit an exercise:**
```
Input:  edit w/Push Day e/Bench Press
Prompt: Edit fields (e.g. wn/NewWorkout en/NewExercise wt/100 s/3 r/10):
Input:  wt/90 s/4 r/8
Output: Change Recorded! Edited Workout:
        Push Day
        Bench Press | Weight: 90kg | Sets: 4 | Reps: 8
```

> **Note:** Pressing Enter without typing anything at the prompt will be regarded as no changes.

### Feature 16: Remarks

**Purpose:** Adds comments and remarks to a workout session.

**Format:**
```
log e/EXERCISE_NAME [w/WORKOUT_NAME] remark/REMARK
```

**Example:**
```
Input:  log e/Bench Press w/Push Day remark/Lightweight babyyy
Output: Stats updated for Bench Press in Push Day!
        Remark added: Lightweight babyyy
```

> **Note:** Remarks are saved to `history.txt` and displayed when you run `loglist`.

### Feature 17: Log Workout Session

**Purpose:** Starts or resumes a logging session for today. This command identifies the workout you are currently training and lists its exercises.

**Format:**
```
log w/WORKOUT_NAME
```

**Example:**
```
Input:  log w/Push Day
Output: Session started for Push Day! Let's get those gains.
        PUSH DAY Workout Exercises:
        ...
```

---

### Feature 18: Log Exercise Stats

**Purpose:** Records your actual performance (weight, sets, reps) and an optional remark for a specific exercise. GitSwole uses "Smart Overwriting" to ensure your history remains clean.

**Format:**
```
log e/EXERCISE_NAME [w/WORKOUT_NAME] [wt/WEIGHT] [s/SETS] [r/REPS] [remark/REMARK]
```

* If `w/` is omitted, the most recent active session name is used (Sticky Session).
* If `wt/`, `s/`, or `r/` are omitted, the current values stored in the workout template are used.

**Example:**
```
Input:  log e/Bench Press wt/85 s/3 r/5 remark/Too ez, try up weight
Output: Stats updated for Bench Press in Push Day!
        Remark added: Too ez, try up weight
```

---

### Feature 19: History Storage

**Purpose:** Automatically records every `log` entry into a persistent history file (`docs/history.txt`). This file serves as a chronological diary of your training progress.

**Format:**
(Automatic upon using the `log` command)

---

### Feature 20: View History

**Purpose:** Displays the training history. User can view all logs, or filter by a specific workout or date.

**Format:**
```
loglist
loglist w/WORKOUT_NAME
loglist d/DATE
```
* `loglist` alone prints every logged entry across all dates, in chronological order.
* `loglist w/WORKOUT_NAME` filters the history to only entries belonging to that workout.
* `loglist d/DATE` filters the history to all entries logged on a specific date. Date must follow the `dd-MM-yyyy` format.

**Example** - View complete history:
```
Input:  loglist
Output:
=== COMPLETE LOG HISTORY ===

## FAQ

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Workout templates are saved in `data/workouts.txt`. Workout history logs are saved in `data/history.txt`. Both files are created automatically on first run.

**Q: What happens if I accidentally close the app mid-session?**  
A: Data is saved automatically after every mutating command (`add`, `delete`, `mark`, `edit`), so you will not lose any confirmed entries.

**Q: Can I edit `workouts.txt` or `history.txt` manually?**  
A: Yes, but exercise caution — malformed entries may cause loading errors on the next launch.

**Q: What happens if I type an unrecognised command?**  
A: GitSwole will display an error message. Type `help` to see the list of valid commands.
